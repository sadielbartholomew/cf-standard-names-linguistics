# Most common *n*-grams

## Overview

An [*n*-gram](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/NLP/ClassSlides/Class3-ngrams09/ngrams.pdf) is a sequence of length *n* of tokens (linguistic units). Here we
take single words as the tokens to analyse.

Note here we ignore 1-grams (*n*-grams with *n = 1*, i.e. single words) as these
will be analysed in detail separately.


## Results

The most frequent *n*-grams of words in the full current (10/07/20) Standard
Names table of names for *n = 2* to *n = 15* words, are as follows (note the
underscores in names have been replaced by whitespace to mimic natural text
for enhanced readability):
